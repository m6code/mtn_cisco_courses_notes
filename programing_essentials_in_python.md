## 1 - Introduction to Python and Computer Programming
### **What makes a language**
* **an alphabet**: a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language (e.g., the Latin alphabet for English, the Cyrillic alphabet for Russian, Kanji for Japanese, and so on)
* **a lexis**: (aka a dictionary) a set of words the language offers its users (e.g., the word "computer" comes from the English language dictionary, while "cmoptrue" doesn't; the word "chat" is present both in English and French dictionaries, but their meanings are different)
* **a syntax**: a set of rules (formal or informal, written or felt intuitively) used to determine if a certain string of words forms a valid sentence (e.g., "I am a python" is a syntactically correct phrase, while "I a python am" isn't)
* **semantics**: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense (e.g., "I ate a doughnut" makes sense, but "A doughnut ate me" doesn't)

* A program written in a high-level programming language is called a **source code** (in contrast to the machine code executed by computers). Similarly, the file containing the source code is called the **source file**.

* There are two different ways of transforming a program from high-level to machine language
1. Compilation - the source program is translated once into machine code.
2. Interpretation - the source program is translated each time the program has to be run

* Advantages of:
    1. Compilation
        * the execution of the translated code is usually faster;
        * only the user has to have the compiler - the end-user may use the code without it;
        * the translated code is stored using machine language - as it is very hard to understand it, your own inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret.

    2. Interpretation:
        * you can run the code as soon as you complete it - there are no additional phases of translation;
        * the code is stored using programming language, not the machine one - this means that it can be run on computers using different machine languages; you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.

* Disadvantages of:
    1. Compilation:
        * the compilation itself may be a very time-consuming process - you may not be able to run your code immediately after any amendment;
        * you have to have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on.

    2. Interpretation:
        * don't expect that interpretation will ramp your code to high speed - your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, so it can't be really fast;
        * both you and the end user have to have the interpreter to run your code.

* If you want to program in Python, you'll need the Python interpreter. You won't be able to run your code without it. Fortunately, Python is free. This is one of its most important advantages.

* Due to historical reasons, languages designed to be utilized in the interpretation manner are often called **scripting languages**, while the source programs encoded using them are called **scripts**.
