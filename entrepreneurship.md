### 1.1.3 Determining Business Focus
* Starting a business specifically for the purpose of solving a problem within the society is called **social entrepreneurship.** In the past, social entrepreneurs were most often found working through corporations whose main purpose is to improve society in some way. 
* Future of a country is built around five key elements
    - An education system.
    - Infrastructure
    - Attitude toward Innovation
    - Supporting government
    - Collaboration between groups
* For some businesses, the main focus is maximizing profits. These companies are called **for-profit companies.** For-profit companies have a responsibility to their investors to make as much profit as they can. 
* A business transaction may be legal and still not be ethical.
* Ethics are standards and rules that help determine what is right and wrong. 
* Ethical business behavior is a combination of business practices and attitudes that promote trust between the business and the people who interact with the business. These people are called the business stakeholders and include customers, employees, and investors. 
* To promote ethical behavior, many companies publish a code of ethics. In its simplest form, a code of ethics is a written document that describes the behavior that a company expects from its employees. 

* A legal responsibility of the entrepreneur is to decide which legal structure is best for the business. The structure defines who owns the business, the way a business is taxed, who is entitled to share in the profits of the business, and who is responsible for the debts of the business. Some basic structures include:
    * Sole proprietorship: owned by one person who is responsible for all debt of the company and entitled to the profits.
    * Partnership: owned by two or more people who are personally responsible for all debt and share the profits.
    * Corporation: enters contracts, sue, get sued, pay taxes ... separately from its owners. It is an entity in it's own right and thus responsible for its debts and obligations. Usually more expensive and complicated.
    * Non-profit corporation: mission is to improve society in some way.
    * Cooperative: owned and controlled by the customers who uses its service.
## 1.2 Generating Income
### 1.2.1 Generating Income from Sales.
* Marketing is the way a company tells its target market that it understands their needs and has a product available to meet those needs.
* Marketing attracts potential customers to a business and helps the entrepreneur find people who are interested in buying his product. But marketing a product is not the same as selling a product.
* The key to selling is explaining how the features of the product benefit the customer.

### 1.2.2 Generating Income from Funding
* There are two types of funding:
    1. Debt: The entrepreneur borrows money from a person or an institution, making a commitment to make regular payments on the loan, including paying interest. Interest is the fee that is charged by investors for the temporary use of their money. 
    2. Equity: The entrepreneur trades a percentage of ownership for money. The investor will receive a percentage of future profits.
* Traditional Funding sources include: personal funds, family and friends, business loans from financial institutions, private investors, grants.
* Non-Traditional Funding sources include: selling assets, borrowing against a home, barter agreements, finance companies.

## Creating a Presentation
### 1.3.1 Defining the Job Scope
* A scope document is a written document that details what the service provider and customer can expect from each other during the course of the job. It establishes expectations from the beginning, so there is no misunderstanding between the service provider and the customer. 
* A Scope document includes the following:
    * Problem statement
    * Deliverables
    * Action plan
    * Resource needs
    * Price and payment terms.
* *Describe the deliverables in as much detail as possible. Service providers should never assume that their customers are thinking the exact same thing that the service providers are!*
* An action plan details the steps that must be taken to accomplish these objectives. It includes:
    * *Task List:* A list of the specific tasks that must be accomplished and in what order they must be completed.
    * *Responsibility assignment:* an explanation of who will complete the tasks.
    * *Timeline:* a statement of when each task will be completed.

* Steps in preparing price estimate:
    1. Determine how long the project will take.
    2. Calculate the labor costs by multiplying wages by the time estimate. For example, if Michael's wage is $25.00 per hour and the estimated time the project will take is 10 hours, then Michael's labor cost is $25 X 10 or $250.00.
    3. Add the cost of any resources provided by the service provider. (This should be detailed in the resource needs.)
    4. Total these costs.
    5. Decide the amount of profit that will be charged.
    6. Add the total costs and the profit together to determine the estimate.
    7. Prepare the written estimate.

### 1.3.2 Developing Presentation Skills.
* A scope document is an excellent way to organize a written or in-person presentation.

    - Think before speaking.
    - Speak in a pleasant voice.
    - Choose words effectively.
    - Use I phrases.
    - Get feedback and follow-up.
